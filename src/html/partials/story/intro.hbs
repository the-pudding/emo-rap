		<p class="prose prose-big">Last month I was listening to Spotify’s Rap Caviar, a hip hop playlist that skews young helps me to stay in touch with what’s popular among the kids. When the top track, “Lucid Dreams” by 19 year-old Juice Wrld,  began to play, I was transported back to high school, feeling all the feels.

		<p class="prose">If you’re old enough, this sounds like quintessential 2000s/2010s emo: <b>Dashboard Confessional</b> lyrics over a Metro Boomin’-type beat.
		</p>
		<p class="prose">It’s already been sub-genred as emo-rap, an emerging hip hop niche of the past few years that has now dominated charts with the success of XXXtentacion and Lil Uzi Vert. But listening to Juice Wrld’s lyrics, I’d argue it is <i>emo</i>—just as emotionally vulnerable and sad as Dashboard, the poster band of mid-2000s teenage angst.
		</p>
		<p class="prose">I began to wonder: <b>who has the saddest lyrics, emo-rappers or Dashboard Confessional?</b> Has Juice Wrld found a way to out-emo emo bands?

				<p class="prose">We’ll replicate a clever method used to find <a href="http://www.rcharlie.com/post/fitter-happier/">Radiohead’s saddest track</a>: take each song’s lyrics and calculate the percentage of words classified as <span class="sad-word">sad</span>.
				</p>
				<p class="prose">Here’s an example from Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Llif3”, where there are 13 words* in its morbidly depressing chorus, with 5 classified as <span class="sad-word">sad</span>. These bars are 38% sad, which—all things considered—is a high number.
